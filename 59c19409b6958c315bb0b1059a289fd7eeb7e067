      "message": "a) Why we need the check for EEPROM presence here? The fruPath variable is set from vpd_tool.cpp after processing json itself, hence we got this path from json and checking it again in json is just redundant. Also, if it is blank, you are already throwing error there.\nb) If eepromPresenceInJson is just used here, then also we do not need this method as editor updateKeyword api will try to open the file path and will set error if path is not found You can check for the error code there.\nc) Now, if the check is anyhow needed here and EEPROM is not found in Json, then do we need to go ahead and call update method at all?",
