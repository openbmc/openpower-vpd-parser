Let\u0027s assume `ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING` is defined. \n\nCurrently, if a `logMessage()` is called with `PlaceHolder::COLLECTION`, and `m_collectionLogger` is not initialized, the `else` default condition at line 50 will be hit and log message goes to journal.\n\nWith this change, if above scenario happens, the log message is not logged to journal and gets lost.",
