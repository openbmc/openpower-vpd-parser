      "message": "As we are not aware of internals of the remove API its difficult to say if there can be any scenario where removal was done but still there is an exception.\nFrom documentation we can conclude that it will return false when API fails either with or without exception. Itâ€™s difficult to say where the exception occurred before or after removal.\nFor us, the caller, call to remove failed so calling create after this does not make any sense is what I think.",
